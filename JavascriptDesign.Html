      <h1><b>Welcome to the world of bees!</b></h1>

      <p>The global bee population is rapidly<br> declining due to widespread pesticides<br> and industrialized production</p>

      <p2>The average lifespan of a bee is about<br>five or six weeks</p2>

      <p3>Bees are so cool that Dreamworks made a movie<br> featuring Jerry Seinfeld as a bee.</p3>

      <p4>The average bee produces about<br> 1/12 tablespoon of honey</p4>

      <p5>Bees are really cool,<br> but wasps are less so.</p5>

      <p6>If a bee lands on your food<br> let them have it it's theirs now</p6>
