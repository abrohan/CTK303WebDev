<h1>The Void</h1>

    <p class="part1-1"> As I'm nearing the end of my college year<b>s</b> I have become increasingly frigh<b>t</b>ened of what lies beyond my school yea<b>r</b>s. I wonder what the future holds as the last w<b>e</b>eks of my education comes to a clo<b>s</b>e. Will I get a job? Will all of the trouble of going to college have been worth it?<br>I prepare my<b>s</b>elf as I inch closer towards those times, as a pit grows in my stomach from the stress that I feel, as I walk into an industry on the brink, the Video Game industry, as mass layoff after mass layoffs cut thousands of jobs from an ever growing list.<br>The anxiety building as I finally embark on my own, no longer a linear path built for me, as I forge my own.</p>

    <p class="part2-1"> Sometimes it feels a little bleak as I try to sort out what I want. The future is scary but we have to keep moving forwar<b>d</b>.<br>I always want<b>e</b>d to grow up fast, but <b>n</b>ow I look back and m<b>i</b>ss the simpler times. You never <b>a</b>ppreciate the good times until they are gone.<br>Al<b>l</b> of this is true, but ultimately it is not all that bad.</p>

    <p class="part3"> There is so much to look forward to in the future. I <b>H</b>ave so many ideas that I want to share and things I want t<b>o</b> do and create. Des<b>p</b>ite how long I've worked to get here I have barely started.<br> With the <b>e</b>nd of college comes a new chapter and new opportunities and I want to chase those.<br> As I stand in front of the door to my future, I open that door an march onwards.</p>
